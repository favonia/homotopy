{"name":"homotopy","body":"**Homotopy type theory** establishes new connections between category theory, homotopy theory and type theory. Many interesting proofs and theorems within this theory can be approximately formalized in Coq, Agda and possibly other proof assistants. This repository hosts my own formalization (with some of [Nils Anders Danielssonâ€™s code](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/repos/equality/)) in Agda. Check [this site](http://homotopytypetheory.org/) for more information in homotopy type theory.","tagline":"My Agda code for Homotopy Type Theory","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
