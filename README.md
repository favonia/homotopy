# Introduction

This repository hosts my Agda code for homotopy type theory.
Homotopy type theory is a new type theory
seeking the connections between (abstract) homotopy theory,
type theory and category theory.
For more information about this theory
I recommend [this blog](http://homotopytypetheory.org).
